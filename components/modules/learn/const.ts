This means that it can essentially revert back to its polyp stage and start its life cycle all over again.",
  "Did you know that there is a type of fungus that turns ants into 'zombies'? Ophiocordyceps unilateralis infects carpenter ants and takes control of their bodies, causing them to climb to high locations and bite onto a leaf before producing spores. This fungus essentially turns the ants into 'zombies' to help spread its own spores.",
